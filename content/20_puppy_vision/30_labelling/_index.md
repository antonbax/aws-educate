## Labelling

To tell the machine what it needs to learn, you need to teach it what it has to recognize! We do this by drawing boxes around the puppies in your photos.

1. Click on **Add** and type in *Puppies*.
2. Select on all the images by clicking the small blue square and click draw bounding box.
3. Use the mouse to draw a box around the puppies.
4. After you have drawn a box around all the puppies in all the photos, click done.
