## The AWS Puppy Challange 

### What is the Puppy Challenge? 

The Puppy Challenge is a fun, innovative workshop that teaches you the basics of machine learning on the AWS Cloud! The purpose of this challenge is to use AWS Rekognition, a cloud based machine learning program, to recognize a puppy in a photo! 

### What is Machine Learning

Machine learning is the idea that computers can learn from data, find patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It is an important technology which is being used to help make driver-less cars! Machine learning can detect anything you teach it, from humans to buildings and of course puppies! It does this by using algorithms to learn what objects look like from a collection of initial photos (called a data set!) 

Today you are going to learn how to use the Cloud to make your own machine learning program that recognizes puppies so that in the future you can help build amazing technologies that will help change the world ! 

### Workshop Goals

* Train our own Rekognition model to detect puppies in photographs 
* Learn about the basic cloud computing skills needed for Machine Learning 
* Understand how machine learning and the Cloud can be used in the future
