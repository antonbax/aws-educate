# AWS Educate Workshops

## Puppy and Kitten Vision AWS Educate Workshop

### What is it

The Puppy Challenge is a fun, innovative workshop that teaches you the basics of machine learning on the AWS. The purpose of this challenge is to use cloud computing to teach your computer how to recognize a puppy or kitten in a photo. We will be using AWS Rekognition, which is our computer software that uses machine learning to detect if puppies are in the photo.

### What is Machine Learning

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to use math to detect patterns. It is an important technology which is being used to help make driverless cars! Machine learning can detect anything you teach it, from humans to buildings and of course puppies and kittens.

Today we are going to learn how to make your own machine learning program so that in the future you can help build amazing technologies that will help change the world.

### Workshop Goals

* Create your own machine learning model which can detect puppies in photographs.
* Learn about the basic skills needed for Machine Learning.
* Understand how machine learning and the cloud can be used in the future.
